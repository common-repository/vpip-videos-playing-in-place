vPIP (videos Playing In Place) dynamically embeds video after the viewer clicks on it's link. And the video layout is virally shared.

== Description ==

vPIP lets you design where the video should play on your blog with an image or text link.  Then when the viewer clicks on the link, the vPIP javascript code embeds the video.  A button below the videos allows it to be shared continually from site to site.

vPIP has been tested from version 1.5 to 2.3

Turn off ThickBox in the admin Options-vPIP Config menu by unchecking "Enable ThickBox?".  ThickBox sets up global CSS settings to center on a page that can conflict with other CSS.
